# Tic-Tac-Toe WebApplication
Overview
In this project, I developed a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game as part of my internship at Prasunet Pvt. Ltd. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with "O" or "X". The game ends when one player successfully aligns three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, or when all spaces are filled, resulting in a draw.

Technologies and Libraries Used
HTML5: Used to structure the game interface and elements.
CSS3: Applied for styling the game with a modern and responsive design, including animations and hover effects.
JavaScript (ES6): Used to implement the game logic, handle user interactions, and update the game state in real-time.
Visual Studio Code: Utilized as the primary code editor for development.
Google Chrome Developer Tools: Used for testing and debugging the application.

Key Features
Interactive Game Board: Players can click on boxes to place their marks, with alternating turns between "O" and "X".
Winner Detection: The game checks for winning patterns after each turn and displays a congratulatory message for the winner.
Draw Detection: If all boxes are filled without a winner, a draw message is displayed.
Reset Functionality: Players can start a new game or reset the current game at any time.

What I Learned
HTML and CSS Proficiency: I enhanced my skills in structuring HTML documents and applying CSS for styling. I learned how to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
JavaScript ES6 Features: I gained experience using modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, template literals, and const/let declarations. I also improved my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling.
Modular Code Structure: I learned how to structure my code in a modular and reusable way, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug.
Problem-Solving Skills: I developed better problem-solving skills by debugging issues, optimizing the game logic, and ensuring the application runs smoothly across different browsers.
User Experience Design: I learned how to design an intuitive and engaging user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

Conclusion
This project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of front-end web development and the practical application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a valuable experience that helped me improve my coding skills, attention to detail, and ability to create interactive web applications.
